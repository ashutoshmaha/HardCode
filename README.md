# HardCoded

This repository is the collection of all my projects which are mostly written in Python. 
I have done each of my project with extensive research and understanding of the topic. 
I have tried to annotate each chunk of the code so that it becomes lucid to read.
I have used references from the stack overflow and w3schools as well as some YouTube videos.
